## PuppetDB 6.2.0

### New features

- **Improved PostgreSQL support.** PuppetDB is now compatible with PostgreSQL version 10 and later. [PDB-3857](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3857)

- **New Puppet Query Language (PQL) operators.** You can now use the negative operators `!=` and `!~`. [PDB-3471](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3471)

### Bug fixes

- **PuppetDB no longer causes PostgreSQL to create large amounts of temporary files during garbage collection.** This issue caused PostgreSQL's log to flood if the `log_temp_files` option was set to a small enough value. [PDB-3924](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3924)

### Security

- **Removed jackson-databind dependency.** We've blacklisted the jackson-databind dependency to resolve several security issues. [PDB-4236](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4236)
